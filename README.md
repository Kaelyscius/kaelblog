It's a project to develop skills on Symfony.

The goal is to learn and try to master Symfony, but also to learn new things and test!

For the moment the project to some subjects:
- A part dedicated to my stream gaming activity.
- A resume section to talk about my skills.
- A blog party to talk about dev, gaming etc.
- Admin part to manage all that!

And surely much more!

In the code, I will try to keep good development practice, but I'm listening to advice that can be given me.

This will allow me to progress also in tests and test realization.

Part of the development will be shown in stream! This project will take the time it takes, but we will create it quietly.
